Xtreme Image Cacher README

The ImageUtils library allows you to easily load images from the web asynchronously.  It handles network calls, image caching, and releasing Activity/Fragment references automatically.  There is also optimization options such as preloading images and controlling the size of the memory cache.

Implementation details can be found at the wiki: https://github.com/xtremelabs/xl-image_utils_lib-android/wiki
