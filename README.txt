Xtreme Labs Image Utilities Library

The Image Utilities library is a full-featured image management and caching solution that can be set up in a matter of minutes. This library automatically manages the process of loading images from the network or from disk, and includes a number of memory saving features and performance optimizations. The advanced options available within this library are masked by a simple interface, giving developers access to powerful options and APIs that are quick and easy to implement.

The implementation time of this library, in most cases, is under ten minutes, and can save developers days, weeks, or months worth of development versus building a custom solution.

Implementation details can be found at the wiki: https://github.com/xtremelabs/xl-image_utils_lib-android/wiki
